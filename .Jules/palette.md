**Learning:** Destructive actions like task deletion should always have a confirmation dialog to prevent data loss. Icon-only buttons must have tooltips, and selection widgets like ChoiceChip require meaningful labels for accessibility. Modern Flutter (3.22+) requires using `toARGB32()` and `withValues()` for color manipulations.
**Action:** Always implement confirmation dialogs for deletes, add tooltips to icon buttons, and use modern Color APIs in new Flutter projects.
